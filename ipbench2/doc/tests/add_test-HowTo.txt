This HowTo is a simple guide describing modifications required to the build and 
configuration system when adding a test to ipbench, it does not define an
actual example, examples can be taken from tests that have already been
implemented in the ipbench framework, see: src/tests/dummy.

After creating a seperate directory for your test under /src/tests, you will
need to update some automake, autoconf files.

ipbench2/configure.in
    AC_OUTPUT
        Add the Makefile target that autoconf will generate after automake has
	been run. This means you will create a Makefile.am file to build the
	test.

ipbench2/src/tests/Makefile.am
    SUBDIRS
        Append your test directory to the SUBDIR target.

ipbench2/src/tests/<testname>/Makefile.am
    lib<test>_la_SOURCES
       All files that are used for the generation of the test must be included
       in this variable, or make dist will not generate a complete source tree.
